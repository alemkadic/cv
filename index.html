        <p> I consider myself a hardworking and reliable individual that has experience in different fields based on my previous employment. Each of those employments had different tasks and responsibilities. These jobs include experience in customer
          support, hospitality, sales, and data entry. A lot of similar skills were needed to complete these daily activities, but each job carried its responsibility. Also, a lot of improvisation was needed along the way, during which I developed
          skills
          to adjust myself and my knowledge to complete a certain task. I can say that I am proficient in Microsoft Office, can utilize fast typing, and complete a given task within the set deadline.</p>
